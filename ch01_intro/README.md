# Chapter 1: Introducing Neural Networks

## What This Chapter Covers
- What neural networks are and how they work (conceptually)
- The biological inspiration behind neural networks
- Basic structure: neurons, layers, weights, and biases
- How information flows through a network

## Key Concepts
- **Neuron/Node**: Basic unit that receives inputs and produces an output
- **Weights**: Values that determine the strength of connections
- **Biases**: Additional parameters that shift the activation
- **Layers**: Groups of neurons working together
- **Forward Pass**: Moving data from input to output through the network

## Your Learning Goal
By the end of this chapter, you should understand:
- The high-level architecture of a neural network
- Why we need weights and biases
- How networks are inspired by biological neurons

## Notes
Take notes here as you read! Write down:
- Key insights or "aha!" moments
- Questions you have
- Connections to your linear algebra/calculus knowledge
